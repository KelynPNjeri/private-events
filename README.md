# Event App -> Building user session using Rails

Create a Ruby on Rails App to learn how to manage user sessions with Devise gem for Ruby on Rails and associations between models as part of the Microverse learning Curriculum.

## Getting Started
- Fork the repository and create a local one on your computer
- Move to the repository inside the command line using `cd` and the path to the file
- Run `bundle install` and `rails db:migrate`
- Run `rails server` (in case you already have something running on port 3000 run `rails server -p 3001` where the number can be any port you want.)
- inside your browser go to http://localhost:3000/, changing the port number in case you chose a custom one.
- explore the application.

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails version 5.2.4.3
